Project Objectives
==================

- You design your own projectCPU.v and only upload this file on LMS.

- projectCPU.v should both successfully:

  Simulate
  and Synthesize
  
Simulation
==========

- Create a Xilinx ISE project with:

  projectCPU_tb.v
  projectCPU.v
  blram.v
  projectCPU_program.v (read from blram.v)
  
- Should pass syntax.

- Should simulate without any ISE errors.

- The testbench should pass without errors. Loo in outputLog.txt. Total Errors should be 0.

- If not see where your errors are through the messages in outputLog.txt.

- Debug using waveforms. Display the waveform for errorCount.

Synthesis
=========

- Synthesize only projectCPU.v.

- Should have no errors. Pay attention to "multiple drivers" especially.

- Should all eliminate all warnings if possible. Especially pay attention to "latch inferred" messages.

- Review all warnings and sign off on them.

- Warnings on your usage of #1 is okay.
