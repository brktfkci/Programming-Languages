## Binary Max Heap

A Binary Max-Heap is similar to a Binary Min-Heap, but it satisfies the max-heap property, where the parent node's value is greater than or equal to the values of its children. Like the Min-Heap, it's often used for priority queue operations where the maximum element needs to be efficiently extracted.

- Adding Items (insert operation): The insert operation has a worst-case time complexity of `O(logn)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the heap. Similar to the Min-Heap, this operation involves swapping elements upwards along the heap's height until the heap property is satisfied, which takes logarithmic time.

- Removing Items (extract_max operation): The extract_max operation, which removes the maximum element from the heap, also has a worst-case time complexity of `O(logn)`. After removing the maximum element, the operation involves swapping elements downwards along the heap's height to restore the heap property.

- Searching for Items (search operation): The search operation, which checks if an element is in the heap, has a time complexity of `O(n)` in the worst case because it may need to check all elements in the heap.

Binary Max-Heaps are efficient for maintaining a maximum element and extracting it quickly, making them suitable for priority queue operations. Similar to Min-Heaps, they are not optimized for efficient searching. If searching is a common operation, other data structures like binary search trees or hash tables may be more appropriate.
