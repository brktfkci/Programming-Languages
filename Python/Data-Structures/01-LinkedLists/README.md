## Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a reference (link) to the next element in the sequence, forming a chain-like structure. Linked lists come in various types, but two common types are singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In this explanation, I'll focus on a singly linked list.

- Adding Head (add_head operation):
This operation has a time complexity of `O(1)` because it does not depend on the size of the list.

- Removing Head (remove_head operation):
This operation has a time complexity of `O(1)` because it does not depend on the size of the list; it simply updates the head reference.

- Adding Items (append operation):
The append method has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it needs to traverse the list to find the last element and add the new element after it.

- Removing Items (remove operation):
The remove method has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it needs to traverse the list to find and remove the item.

- Searching for Items (search operation):
The search method has a time complexity of `O(n)` because it needs to traverse the list to find the item.

Linked lists are useful for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required because they can efficiently handle these operations by simply updating references. However, they have slower access times `O(n)` compared to arrays `O(1)`, where random access is needed.
