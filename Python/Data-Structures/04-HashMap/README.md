## Hash Map

Using Python's built-in dict (dictionary) data structure, which is essentially a hash table. This dictionary supports adding items (key-value pairs), removing items by key, and searching items by key. Additionally, I'll explain the time complexity for these operations.

- Adding Items (add operation):
The add method (adding a key-value pair) generally has an average time complexity of `O(1)` for adding a single item because it involves computing the hash of the key and inserting it into the appropriate location in the underlying hash table. However, in rare cases, when there are hash collisions, the time complexity for adding an item can be `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of items in the collision chain.

- Removing Items (remove operation):
The remove method (removing a key-value pair) generally has an average time complexity of `O(1)` for removing a single item because it involves locating the item by its key in the hash table. However, in rare cases (when hash collisions occur), it can be `O(n)` in the worst case, where `n`n is the number of items in the collision chain.

- Searching for Items (search operation):
The search method (retrieving a value by key) generally has an average time complexity of `O(1)` for finding a single item because it involves locating the item by its key in the hash table. Again, in rare cases (hash collisions), it can be `O(n)` in the worst case, where `n` is the number of items in the collision chain.

Hash tables are highly efficient data structures for storing and retrieving key-value pairs, offering constant-time (amortized) performance for adding, removing, and searching for items in most cases. However, their performance can degrade in cases of significant hash collisions, which is why it's crucial to have a good hash function and a well-designed load factor to minimize collisions.
