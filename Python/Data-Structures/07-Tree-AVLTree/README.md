## AVL Tree

An AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree) is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees (the balance factor) of any node is at most `1`. This self-balancing property ensures that the tree remains relatively balanced, which leads to efficient worst-case time complexities for adding, removing, and searching items.

- Adding Items (add operation): In the worst case, adding an item to an AVL tree takes `O(logn)` time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because AVL trees are self-balancing, and the maximum height of the tree remains logarithmic.

- Removing Items (remove operation): In the worst case, removing an item from an AVL tree also takes `O(log n)` time. This is because AVL trees are designed to maintain balance during insertion and removal, and the height of the tree remains logarithmic.

- Searching for Items (search operation): In the worst case, searching for an item in an AVL tree also takes `O(logn)` time.

In summary, AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure efficient worst-case time complexities for adding, removing, and searching for items. Thanks to their self-balancing property, you can typically achieve O(log n) time complexity for these operations, even in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This makes AVL trees a suitable choice for many applications that require efficient searching and maintaining a balanced tree structure.
