## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. 

- Adding Items (add operation): Adding an item to this binary tree takes `O(h)` time, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, a binary tree can degenerate into a linked list, making h equal to the number of nodes. Hence, the worst-case time complexity can be `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes.

- Removing Items (remove operation): The removal operation also takes `O(h)` time. It can be `O(n)` in the worst case if the tree is skewed.

- Searching for Items (search operation): Searching for an item in this binary tree also takes `O(h)` time, which can be `O(n)` in the worst case if the tree is skewed.

To improve the worst-case time complexity for adding, removing, and searching, we can consider using a self-balancing binary search tree (e.g., AVL tree or Red-Black tree). These trees ensure that the height remains balanced, resulting in `O(logn)` worst-case time complexity for these operations.
