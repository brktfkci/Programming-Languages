## Trie

A Trie, also known as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys or words in a dynamic set. It is particularly useful for tasks like auto-completion and spell-checking. Each node in the Trie represents a single character, and the path from the root to a node forms a key or word.

- Adding Items (insert operation): Inserting a word into a Trie has a worst-case time complexity of `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of the word being inserted. This is because the algorithm traverses the Trie depthwise, creating nodes as necessary.

- Removing Items (remove operation): Removing a word from a Trie has a worst-case time complexity of `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of the word being removed. This is similar to the insert operation but involves marking the end-of-word flag as `False` when the word is deleted.

- Searching for Items (search operation): Searching for a word in a Trie also has a worst-case time complexity of `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of the word being searched for. The search involves traversing the Trie nodes until the end of the word is reached or an intermediate node is not found.

Tries are efficient for storing and searching for strings or words with a common prefix, making them well-suited for tasks like auto-completion and spell-checking. Their time complexity for insert, search, and remove operations is primarily determined by the length of the words involved.
