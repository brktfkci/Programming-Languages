## Container With Most Water (Leetcode Question 11)

### Question
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`

- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`
